## Description
This app functions entirely within the command line as an interface to create, read, update and delete records in a SQL database. The records are representative of employees of a fictional ski resort company with data about their department, role, salary and manager. The app is written entirely in JavaScript using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL2 as frameworks. The app is deployed using Node.js.

## Details and Learnings
- I chose to use MySQL and raw SQL queries for this project. Leveraging a module like Sequelize could have helped to allow for the code to be more concise.
- JOINs and aliases became important to ensure that the data was readable and useable within the UX confines of the command line
- When query parameters were generated dynamically by the user input it was important to call those outside the query and reference with a ? to help prevent SQL injections.
- I am unaware of a way to 'go backwards' in inquirer if the user changes their mind after selecting an option. The application can be restarted, but for this reason I felt it was useful to include 'Cancel' options for at least the more impactful Delete options.
- I would have liked to have hosted by js code within separate files for a cleaner file structure. The loops and callbacks between the functions and the prompts made this challenging.
